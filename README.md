This fork of Meteor should add few useful features & fixes. 
To do:
- Better Steal - a regex based item detection, that will allow players to steal only items they want to
- Better AutoCraft - it will allow users to create own recipes - for example, if a server has custom recipe, players will be able to craft it automatically using this feature. Original future allows only vanilla recipes
- Better Sort - inventory sorting will also check the item's name and description, and maybe enchantments?
